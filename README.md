## Map Viewer POC using NestJS, NextJS & Google Maps ##

Map Viewer POC â€“ [NestJS, Next.js, Google Maps API]
A proof of concept (POC) application that visualizes geolocation data by plotting multiple locations on a dynamic map.
Integrated with third-party APIs to fetch additional contextual data for each point.
Implemented customizable map layers (e.g., traffic, terrain) to enhance visual insights.
Built using NestJS (backend) and Next.js (frontend) for a full-stack Javascript solution.

## Getting Started

1)Installing the packages:
Using the terminal, access the app folder ./MAP-VIEWER/map-viewer-app,
